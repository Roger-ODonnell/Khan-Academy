**Khan Acadamy Projects**

This website is to serve as a display of my knowledge learned via Khan Acadmey.

**Current Focus: Algoritms** 

I hope to update this site as I progress and may in future intergrate it with my other site. 
[Developers Struggles](https://developers-struggle.ie/). The aim of this site is to display in blog format and projects my experience in web dev.

However this **Khan Academy** site is outside of my current scope on that website so I am taking up this challenge to put to action in my workplace.
